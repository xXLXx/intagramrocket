A responsive and elegant way to present your offer to your visitors. Create a new pricing table now and copy-paste the shortcode anywhere.

== Description ==
This plugin adds a “Pricing Tables” tab in the admin panel which allows you to create pricing tables for your website the easy way. You can quickly add features to your different plans, choose a color (as well as many other options) and display your price table anywhere with a simple shortcode. What you see is what you get, and it’s totally free.

= No limitation for the Free version =
The Free version of the Responsive Pricing Table plugin is **not limited**.

The [PRO version](https://wpdarko.com/items/responsive-pricing-table-pro) adds new features: **skins**, **tooltips** and **equalizer**. Skins are new designs for your pricing tables, tooltips are “info bubbles” that you can easily add to your features. The plan equalizer automatically evens out your plans' height.
