== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I use this in a widget? =

Just place the shortcode into a text widget. If that doesn't work (it just renders [mi-testimonial id="sdf454df"] in text) then that means your theme isn't 'widgetized' which you can fix easily by adding 1 tiny piece of code to your theme functions.php:

`add_filter('widget_text', 'do_shortcode');`

Add this code above to fuctions.php between the `<?php` and `?>` tags. A good place would be either at the very top or the very bottom of the file. Once you've done this you should be able to use shortcode in widgets now.

= The layout is broken =

It's most likely just a matter of tweaking the css.

= Where can I get support for this plugin? =
